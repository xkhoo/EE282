# Integrating Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) Functional Annotations and Environmental Metadata for Downstream Machine Learning Analysis
## Introduction
Microbial communities are known to influence ecosystem functioning and contribute to the natural carbon pool across the Earth system. For instance, soil microbes contribute to soil carbon pool by driving the transformation of plant litter into microbial biomass, mediating the enzymatic breakdown of complex polymers, and stabilizing carbon (Liang et al. 2017). Despite this, many conventional Earth Systems Models (ESMs) have often applied oversimplified parameterizations (Zhuang et al. 2004; Riley et al. 2011), failing to capture the complexity of interactions between microbes and changing environments. ESMs that consider microbial aspects usually adopt parameter values obtained from lab-cultivated microorganisms, which may differ from those found in a specific location (Sulman et al. 2018). To address this limitation, the functional potential seen in complex living systems can be more accurately represented using microbial trait information derived from increasingly available meta-omics data, including metagenomics. Integrated with new machine learning (ML) methods, these high-dimensional data can support ESM development by revealing spatiotemporal patterns and quantifying relationships between environmental drivers and carbon-loss variables. Nevertheless, converting raw genomic annotations into a standardized dataset suitable for trait–environment inference remains a major practical challenge as it requires careful quality control, consistent trait encoding, normalization, and robust validation of trait sparsity and co-occurrence patterns. To enable downstream predictive work, my current project will build an end-to-end bioinformatics pipeline that harmonizes metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) functional traits with environmental predictors. The goal of this project is not to train a predictive model, but rather to generate a clean “ML-ready” feature matrix along with exploratory diagnostics necessary to demonstrate that the matrix is both biologically interpretable and technically suitable for downstream analysis.
## Data
  I will obtain publicly available MAGs and their associated metadata such as geographical coordinates and genome information from the Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes (JGI IMG/M) database (Chen et al. 2022). These MAGs will first be filtered using genome quality metrics (completeness and contamination) and dereplicated to eliminate redundancy among closely related genomes. I will then calculate the relative abundance of MAGs both by aggregating MAGs within dereplication clusters and by using only representative “winner” genomes for each cluster. Medium-quality genomes will be annotated for functional traits using dbCAN3 (Zheng et al. 2023) and microTrait (Karaoz and Brodie 2022).  Site environmental variables such as climate, soil, topography, and vegetation index will be derived from geographical coordinates associated with each MAG. These variables will be extracted from different established global gridded products and reprojected to the same spatial resolution. 
## Questions
From my data, I am interested in quantifying how quality-control filtering changes the dataset and identifying which filters contribute most to data loss. I will then examine trait prevalence and sparsity to characterize the structure of the trait matrix, distinguishing core traits that are widespread from rare traits that are highly localized or clade-specific. I will evaluate how normalization and transformation choices (genome size normalization and community-weighted mean estimation) affect trait distributions and relative comparisons among sites. Finally, I will explore whether traits co-vary in interpretable using trait-correlation heatmaps and principal component analysis (PCA), which may reveal modules or guild-like groupings that could later be summarized for downstream modeling.
## Feasibility
The proposed project is feasible within the scope of EE282 because the necessary MAG and environmental data are publicly available through the JGI IMG/M database and established global datasets. The proposed pipeline makes use of common data processing techniques taught in the course as well as open-source bioinformatics tools. The project's emphasis on exploratory data analysis and visualization fits in nicely with the deliverables and course themes. I can finish the work and generate reproducible results because the scope is suitable for the deadline and I have past familiarity with Unix, R, and simple python scripting.
